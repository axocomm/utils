# utils

This is just a collection of a few command line utilities that might be useful.

- `hue` -- command line utility for controlling Hue lightbulbs
- `lan-hosts` -- a script to enable and disable `/etc/hosts` entries
- `nt` -- a script that starts a named tmux session with a set of preconfigured windows
- `pktg` -- get package status for specified packages (just USPS and DHL for now)
- `ssh-config` -- just generates a JSON blob of your `~/.ssh/config` if you ever have the need
- `web` -- spin up a named Docker container running Nginx in the current directory

Some contain `install` scripts that should be able to get them
setup. Just make sure `~/bin` is in your `$PATH`.
