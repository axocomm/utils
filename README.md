# utils

This is just a couple random command line utilities that were written
for a few very specific needs. They probably aren't quite complete or
pretty, but they should get some attention every once in a while.

- `hue`

    A command line utility for controlling Hue lightbulbs

- `lan-hosts`

    A script to enable and disable `/etc/hosts` entries

- `nt`

    A script that starts a named tmux session with a set of
    preconfigured windows

- `ssh-config`

    Just generates a JSON blob of your `~/.ssh/config` if you ever
    have the need

- `web`

    Start up a named Docker container running Nginx in the current
    directory

Some contain `install` scripts that should be able to get them
set up. Just make sure `~/bin` is in your `$PATH`.
